# It Academy

It is an academy subsidized by the Barcelona city council in which they offer you facilities and mentors so that you can develop as a programmer.

In my case, I chose this bootcamp because since it is subsidized by the city council, they can kick you out if you don't give the level they ask for, and that makes the level they demand very high.
