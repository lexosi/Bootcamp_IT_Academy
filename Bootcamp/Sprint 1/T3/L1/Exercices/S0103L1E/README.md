# Instructions

Exercise 1
Create a class called Month with a "name" attribute (which will store the name of the month of the year). Adds 11 Month objects (each with its different attribute) in an ArrayList, except for the object with attribute "August". It then inserts into the location that corresponds to this month and demonstrates that the ArrayList maintains the correct order.

Convert the ArrayList from the previous exercise to a HashSet and make sure it doesn't allow duplicates.

Iterates through the list with a for and an iterator.

Exercise 2
Creates and populates a List<Integer>.

Create a second List<Integer> and insert the elements of the first into the second list in reverse order.

Use ListIterator objects to read elements from the first list and insert them into the second.

Exercise 3
Given the file countries.txt (check the resources section) that contains countries and capitals. The program must read the file and save the data in a HashMap<String, String>. The program asks for the user's name, and then must display a random country, saved in HashMap. The user must write the name of the capital of the country in question. If you get it right, you get a point. This action is repeated 10 times. Once the capitals of 10 countries have been requested randomly, the user's name and score must be saved in a file called classificacio.txt.
