# Instructions

Create a class "Car" with the attributes: make, model and power. The brand must be static final, the model static and the power final. Demonstrate the difference between the three. Is there one that can be initialized to the class's constructor?

Add two methods to the "Car" class. A static method called brake() and a non-static method called accelerate(). The accelerate method should display on the console: "The vehicle is accelerating" and the brake() method should display: "The vehicle is braking."

Demonstrates how to invoke the static and non-static methods from the main() of the main class.
