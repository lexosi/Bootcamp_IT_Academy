# Instructions

In a music group there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string and percussion instruments.

All instruments have their name and price as attributes. Additionally, they have a method called touch(). This is abstract in the instrument class and therefore must be implemented in the child classes. If a wind instrument is being played, the method must display on the console: "A wind instrument is playing", if a string instrument is being played: "A string instrument is playing" and if a string instrument is being played: percussion: "A percussion instrument is playing."

The loading process for a class only takes place once. It demonstrates that loading can be caused by the creation of the first instance of this class or by accessing a static member of it.
