# Instructions

The Java Lambdas and Streams API of Java 8+ must be used for all exercises.

Exercise 1
Starting from a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that contain the letter 'o'. Print the result.

Exercise 2
You have to do the same as in the previous point, but now, the method must return a list with Strings that, in addition to containing the letter “o”, also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

Exercise 3
Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all elements in the list with a lambda.

Exercise 4
Make the same impression as the previous point, but using method reference.

Exercise 5
Create a Functional Interface with a method called getPiValue() that must return a double. From the main() of the main class, instantiate the interface and give it the value 3.1415. Call the getPiValue() method and print the result.

Exercise 6
Create a list with numbers and text strings and sort the list with the strings from shortest to longest.

Exercise 7
Using the list from the previous exercise, now order it in reverse, from longest chain to shortest.

Exercise 8
Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called reverse(). This method must receive and must return a String. In the main() of the main class, inject the body of the method into the interface created by a lambda, so that it returns the same string that it receives as a parameter but in reverse. Invokes the interface instance by passing it a string and checks if the result is correct.
