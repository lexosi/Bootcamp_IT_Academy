# Instructions

You can use Java exclusively, or the Apache Commons IO library if you prefer.

Exercise 1
Create a class that lists alphabetically the contents of a directory received by parameter.

Exercise 2
Adds to the class in the previous exercise the functionality of listing a directory tree with the contents of all its levels (recursively) so that they are printed on the screen in alphabetical order within each level, also indicating if it is a directory (D) or a file (F), and its last modification date.

Exercise 3
Modify the previous exercise. Now, instead of displaying the result on the screen, it saves the result in a TXT file.

Exercise 4
Adds the functionality to read any TXT file and display its contents through the console.

Exercise 5
Now the program must serialize a Java Object to a .ser file and then deserialize it.
