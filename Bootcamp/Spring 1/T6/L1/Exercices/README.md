# Instructions

Exercise 1
Create a class called NoGenericMethods that stores three objects of the same type, along with methods to store and extract these objects and a constructor to initialize all three. Checks that arguments can be put in any position in the constructor call.

Exercise 2
Create a class called Person with the attributes first name, last name, and age. Then create a class called GenericMethods whose generic method accepts three arguments of generic type. This method should only print to the screen the arguments it has received. In the main() of the main class, it calls the generic method with different types of parameters.

Example: an object of the Person class, a String and a primitive type.

In this way you have verified that any type of parameter can be passed to it and in any order.
