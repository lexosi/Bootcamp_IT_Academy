# Brief explanation of the topics covered in this Sprint

Design patterns provide us with a concrete solution that applies to common problems, in a context of software development.

Patterns allow for homogenizing the approach to solving certain problems, avoiding reinventing solutions that already exist and have proven effective.

Thus, anyone who develops software and is familiar with design patterns will easily find how to resolve situations that may require their application, and will correctly interpret the code contained to them.

## General Objectives

Design software through advanced structures, which are always established on the basis of patterns.

Start working as a team (un indispensable requirement), integrating your developments into collaborative platforms.

## Specific Objectives

Creational patterns

Structural patterns

Behavior patterns
