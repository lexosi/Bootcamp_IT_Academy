# Exercice

Create a class that replicates the operation of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by the Main class, which will allow entering options by console.

The 'Undo' class must save the last commands entered. It should allow adding or removing commands, as well as listing the last commands entered (similar to the 'history' command in Linux).
The 'Undo' class must implement a Singleton pattern.
